Ocaml_kgx provides libraries to help producing .kgx files for visualizations for programs made in OCaml.

The kdata, kgraph and kplacement libraries are partial reimplementation in OCaml from the KLighD KGraph and KRendering libraries.

The inteLib library provides an intermediate graph structure that can then be translated into .kgx files. 
This structure is a graph structure where the nodes only describe the type of operation they corresponds to.
